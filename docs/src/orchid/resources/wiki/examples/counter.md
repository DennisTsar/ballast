# {{ page.title }}

This example is just a simple counter to demonstrate the bare basics of sending Inputs and updating the ViewModel State.

<p style="
    display: block;
    z-index: 10000;
    position: relative;
    overflow: scroll;
    border: thin solid black;
    ">
<canvas id="ComposeTarget"></canvas>
</p>
