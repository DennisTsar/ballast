# {{ page.title }}

The "Kitchen Sink" example demonstrates the usage of all of Ballasts core APIs. It is most useful when viewed from the
{{ 'Ballast Debugger' | anchor }}.

<div id="example_kitchen_sink"></div>

_Pro Tip: Open your {{ 'Ballast Debugger' | anchor }} with this page open to see all Ballast activity in real-time, or
just read the browser's Console logs._
