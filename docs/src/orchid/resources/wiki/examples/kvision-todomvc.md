[KVision][1] is an object-oriented web framework for Kotlin/JS, providing a more traditional MVC approach to building 
Kotlin web applications as compared to Compose. KVision has modules to support binding Ballast ViewModels to KVision 
UIs.

The [todomvc-ballast][2] example includes a complete KVision application built with Ballast state management. This 
example project is built and maintained by the KVision community.
